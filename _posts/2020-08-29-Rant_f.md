### Qualifications

August 2020.

Maybe society is right. Maybe I should have gone to college for a few more years. Will another degree make me more/less qualified than my peers ?. But is qualification truly quantifiable. Honestly, what makes a human qualified. Is it judged by the knowledge base, is it judged by our elaborate resumes or by our ideas. Or simply put, is it a variable quantity that fluctuates based on a subjective sense of what a truly qualified person is or should look/act like. Questions like these will definitely open up a giant pandora's box. There is still no set threshold based on which, a judgement function can be calculated that will accurately determine if someone is truly qualified or not. 
Until then, we are more likely to be stuck in this infinite loop of battling constant imposter syndrome. Am I good enough ?. What happens if I am not ?

I have spent the last two years in hiding, staying away from everybody that I once knew and loved. I have disengaged completely from the traditional norms that dictate good or bad altogether. It is a miserable existence, but it's worth it, because I don't have to care anymore..!!.

This is what I have understood.

Whatever you want to do in life, whether it is a job at your dream company, or you want to build cool products for everybody to use.Don't let anybody quantify qualification. The key to doing that -- BE IRREPLACEABLE. That's the only way to escape the loop.
