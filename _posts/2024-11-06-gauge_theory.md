### The need for Gauge field theories

## Introduction

Let's begin by trying to understand the necessity of studying a field
theory approach to quantum mechanics and as the title suggests why we
need gauge field theories. We will start off by understanding how gauge
theory was formalized, invariance and symmetry and from there we will
work our way up to how we can use gauge theory to construct strong and
weak interactions (the strong force and the weak force). One thing that
needs to be considered while studying field theories , we are trying to
understand processes that occur at very small i.e. (quantum-mechanical)
scales and very large (relativistic) energies. One might ask why we must
study the quantization of fields. Just like the classical formalism
approach,~ why can't we just quantize relativistic particles the way we
quantized non relativistic particles? . The answer to that question is
simple. When we try to quantize relativistic particles at high energies
and shorter distances, the wave equation breaks down. In other words,
the Schrodinger equation works for a free particle , but when you try to
add relativity to it, it breaks down. We also run into other problems
like negative energy solutions, a disorder in first and second order
derivatives, negative probability densities etc.~ Therefore, a 
totally new framework is needed to deal with particles (fixed number of particles
or otherwise) at relativistic levels. This is how quantum field theory
was formalized and As we have been hearing since high school, particles
are just field excitations acting as operators on a 2D Hilbert space. I
am assuming that you as the reader are familiar with concepts like
principle of least action, four vectors, Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
formalism. If not, check out any MIT OCW playlist. 

##  How gauge theory was formalized


If we consider the dynamics of a particle as Sir Issac Newton had formulated in classical mechanics, it was carried into perfection by both Lagrange and Hamilton. The space-time distinction still remained vivid. In field theories, if we consider a field $ϕ(x, t)$ the spatial variables x have joined the temporal time variable t. The concept of “Spacetime” has come into being as the 4-dimensional
aspect upon which field theories are written. Field theories as a matter of fact have actually have predisposed relativity


for eg:- the Hamiltonian formulation of the least action principle:- which suggests that-

$\delta\int_{time-interval}^{}Ldt = 0$

  
 The field theory counterpart will be:

$\delta\int_{space-time} \mathcal{L}dxdydzdt = 0$
 
 where $\mathcal{L}$  is the  Lagrangian density.


Considering a real scalar field, we can consider its Lagrangian. That is the change in action at a distance and thus derive the Euler Lagrange equations of motion. We can consider several local fields in interaction with one another, giving rise

to complex scalar fields.  More on that later.

Now, coming to the question of how gauge theory was formalized , if we consider classical electrodynamics and we try to add relativity to it, we get thrown into certain contradictions. In classical electrodynamics , particles are treated as well defined points, unlike in quantum electrodynamics where there is a combination approach. Considering a point charge, the field produced by a point charge is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the charge. This as we know is called the coulomb's law. Thus the potential of the field $\phi = \frac{e}{R}$. If we have a system of charges, then the field produced by the system is equal to the superposition of the sum of each field individually. Given the formula,

  
$R$  is the distance from the charge $e$.

$\phi_a = \sum_{}^{} \frac{e_b}{R_{ab}}$

where $R_{ab}$  is the distance between the charges $e_a$ , $e_b$

  
But, we know that in relativity , every elementary particle must be considered as point-like. So, at $ R-> 0$, the potential becomes infinity. Thus, according to electrodynamics, the electron would have to have "infinite" self energy and mass. This violates the fundamental framework of classical electrodynamics. Thus special relativity working conjointly   with the principle of superposition throws us into contradictions when it comes to shorter distances.

So, we needed a new "theory of interaction" to design free fields and thus, we came up with gauge theory where the dynamics remain invariant under certain changes/ transformations,

  

$\mathcal{L}  \rightarrow \mathcal{L}^{'}  = \mathcal{L} + \partial_\mu A_\mu$


where  $A_{\mu}$ is the gauge field representing interactions and $A_\mu$ can be anything.

let's talk about invariance for a second:-


## Invariance

  
1. Definition:

   - Invariance is a broader concept and refers to the property of remaining unchanged under a specific transformation or set of transformations.

   - In physics, a system or an  equation is said to be invariant under a particular transformation if applying that transformation does not alter the physical laws or properties described by the system or equation.

1. Examples:

  

   - In classical mechanics, Newton's laws are invariant under Galilean transformations.
   - In special relativity, physical laws are invariant under Lorentz transformations.

  
2. Mathematical Representation:

   - Invariance is often expressed mathematically using transformation rules or equations that remain unchanged after a specified transformation.
