## **Aim**

> "We are data scientists—that is, our job is to understand how to analyze and interpret data. When we analyze the data around covid-19, we are very concerned. The most vulnerable parts of society, the elderly and the poor, are most at risk, but controlling the spread and impact of the disease requires us all to change our behavior."- Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas of fast.ai.

With the outbreak crossing over 110,000 positive cases throughout the world., I beleive its time for all of us to come together as a community. My aim isn't to speculate about the possibilities that may or may not happen in the near future. With the rise in daily cases, the speculations on social media has seen a significant growth. The tweets, the status, the posts that sum up the existing speculation, can provide you with either one of two things. The first situation is to provide you with Hope, Hope that underprepares you and the second scenario is to present you with a scene right out of an apocalypse movie. Propagating Extremism from either ends of speculations isn't going to do anyone any favours. Instead it would be a disservice to the already affected and panic stricken. Something that will be Helpful in such a situation is Education. Awareness. More facts. Less Hyperbole.

Awareness and a focus on the development of solutions is the best possible position one can hang their hats on in addition to taking preventive measures. Because ultimately, it is a novel Coronavirus and novel problems require novel solutions. As you have seen, so many countries have already undertaken.


I am going to highlight a few solutions that are being developed currently and also a few insights on how to interpret existing data. The focus will be on Structure and Action Mechanism of Covid19, Growth Factor, Exponential Growth, computational Drug Discovery and Deep Learning. 

## **Introduction**

Coronavirus or COVID-19 is slowly shaping out to be that once in a lifetime pathogen that Bill Gates had warned us about in 2015 . See [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Af6b_wyiwI) Ted talk he gave a few years ago. 

>"If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades, it's most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war. Not missiles, but microbes."- Bill Gates, 2015.

 This is an opportunity for all of us to come together as a community and try to help as much as we can to spread awareness as well as combat misinformation and panic. 

As I am writing this blog post on March 9,2020, the UN and the WHO has not declared Coronavirus as a Pandemic  although [scientists disagree](https://www.euronews.com/2020/03/07/un-refuses-to-call-coronavirus-outbreak-a-pandemic-scientists-disagree).  COVID-19 as of March 9, 2020 is affecting 109 countries and territories around the world and 1 international conveyance (the Diamond Princess cruise ship harbored in Yokohama, Japan). The number of positive cases recorded so far is at 110,098. The Death toll is at:- 3831. The number of Paitents who have recovered stands at:- 62,302. For the real-time Update on Coronavirus cases you can visit [Worldometres](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/). The number of positive cases detected in India stands at 42, with 3 recoveries. No deaths have been reported so far. 

Currently for COVID-19, the WHO estimates a [Mortality rate](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-death-rate/#who-03-03-20) of 3.4 % as of March 3, 2020.(although it has been challenged by many)
The flu has a [mortality rate of 0.1%](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/health/coronavirus-flu.html). Therefore by pure estimation, COVID-19 has a mortality rate which is 34 times higher than the normal seasonal flu. So, you can see why comparing SARS-CoV2, to any other form of flu epidemic is actually disingenuous. A false comparison nonetheless.

See the Director General's (The WHO) remarks on March 3, 2020 [here](https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19---3-march-2020).

Before, we jump into details, we need to look into the history of coronaviruses. 

## **History of the Coronavirus (SARS-CoV and MERS)**

The corona virus was first identified in a bird in 1937 and its name was derived from the fact that when examined under a microscope it appeared
to have crown like spikes along its surface. 

The first human coronavirus was found in the 1960s in the nose
of a patient with the common cold . There are in fact seven corona viruses that
can infect people and occasionally coronaviruses that infect animals like
bats can evolve to become contagious towards humans.


The outbreak of the 2019-2020 novel Coronavirus has shown many similarities that mirror the SARS outbreak that happened in 2003 in Asia.

Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the strain of virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). It is an [enveloped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_envelope), [single-stranded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA) RNA virus which infects the epithelial cells within the lungs. The virus enters the host cell by binding to the [ACE2 receptor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin_II_receptor). It infects humans, bats, and palm civets. 

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases reported in Wuhan. It is the cause of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It is thought to have a [zoonotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zoonosis) origin.

SARS-CoV-2 does share similarities with other coronaviruses, four of which can cause the common cold. All five viruses have spiky projections on their surfaces and utilize so-called spike proteins to infect host cells. However, the four cold coronaviruses — named 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1 — all utilize humans as their primary hosts. SARS-CoV-2 shares about 90% of its genetic material with coronaviruses that infect bats

The Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) was also a viral respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS‐CoV) that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Approximately 35% of reported patients with [MERS-CoV infection](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-(mers-cov)) have died. 

The [mortality rate](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/covid-19-outbreak-mers-sars-had-higher-fatality-rates/articleshow/74467911.cms?from=mdr) of MERS was 34 % . The 2003 SARS-CoV  had a mortality rate of 9.5 % .  You can read more on the [Epidemiology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_outbreak#Epidemiology). 




### **Incubation Period**

*The period between exposure to an infection and the appearance of the first symptoms is known as the incubation period.*

- As of March 2020, The World Health Organization (WHO) reported an incubation period for 2019-nCoV between [2 and 10 days](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-incubation-period/#ref-1).
- China’s National Health Commission (NHC) had initially estimated an incubation period from [10 to 14 days](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/01/chinas-national-health-commission-news-conference-coronavirus-200126105935024.html) .

Mean incubation period observed:
- [3.0 days](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-incubation-period/#24) (0 - 24 days range, study based on 1,324 cases)
- [5.2 days](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/coronavirus-incubation-period/#52) (4.1 - 7.0 days range, based on 425 cases).

## **Structure and Mechanism of Action of COVID-19**

The 2019-2020 novel coronavirus is a newly discovered strain from the family of coronaviruses that causes respiratory diseases. Humans have been affected by the coronavirus previously as it is one of those responsible for the common cold. It is contagious because it can be ingested through viral droplets i.e, coughing, sneezing and touching infected surfaces. 

The structure of the Coronavirus has multiple parts.

Inside the virus lies the Genetic Encoding which allows the virus to hijack human cells and turn them into virus factories. A protein encapsulates the genetic material known as the viral envelope. The structure of the 2019-2020 coronavirus is a mutation. The virus enters the host cell and most likely as the SARS-CoV, binds to the ACE2, thus allowing the virus entry. The exact mechanism for this is not known.

*Coronavirus outbreak (covid 19) explained through 3D Medical Animation, Video by Scientific Animations. Click on the video above*

 The human cell ingests the virus and once inside the cytoplasm virus's genetic material is revealed, a single-stranded RNA. The virus hijacks the cells machinery to replicate the RNA  and uses the endoplasmic reticulum to form the protein outer layer, after replication the virus is carried
by the Golgi bodies out of the cell in a process known as [exocytosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exocytosis) so that it
can infect other cells meanwhile the stress of viral production on the
endoplasmic reticulum eventually leads to [apoptosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apoptosis) or cell death.

Scientists in China have sequenced the genome and have uploaded the fully sequenced genome to a public database called genbank, while others have
used the sequencing to visualize the structure there is currently no cure or
vaccine for the coronavirus and treatment is only supportive
therefore preventing transmission is an absolute necessity. The fully sequenced Genome can be downloaded from [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/LC528232). The instruction set is in A,C,T,G . (*Four bases--adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), or thymine (T). The two strands are held together by hydrogen bonds between the bases, with adenine forming a base pair with thymine, and cytosine forming a base pair with guanine.*). You can download the full coronavirus text for further analysis. 


### **Coronavirus Mutation**

The new coronavirus, like all other viruses, mutates, or undergoes small changes in its genome. A recently published study suggested that the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, had already mutated into one more and one less aggressive strain. But experts aren't convinced.

In the study, a group of researchers in China analyzed the genomes of coronaviruses taken from 103 patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, in Wuhan, China, the epicenter of the outbreak. The team found differences in the genomes, which they said could be categorized into two "strains" of the coronavirus: the "L" type and the "S" type, the researchers wrote in the study, which was published on March 3 in the journal [National Science Review](https://academic.oup.com/nsr/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nsr/nwaa036/5775463?searchresult=1) 

> "The researchers found the "L" type, which they deemed the more aggressive type, in 70% of the virus samples. They also found that the prevalence of this strain decreased after early January. The more commonly found type today is the older, "S" type, because "human intervention" such as quarantines may have reduced the ability of the "L" type to spread"- [Coronavirus Mutation](https://www.livescience.com/coronavirus-mutations.html) by Livemint.

## **COVID-19 Growth Factor, Exponential Growth and Data Analysis**

In the midst of the Coronavirus outbreak, there have been several attempts at the non drug discovery side of things. Data analysis is one of those areas. The novel Coronavirus Dataset 2019 on kaggle is one such example. For the last couple of months, several kernels have been made and published. Exploratory Data Analysis, Clustering, Visualization, Prediction, regression analysis are just to name a few. Extraordinary effort is being made on the Data Analysis side. I will attach a few datasets, so that you can join in and contribute as well. 

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/corona-virus-report)
- [https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19](CCSEGISandData)
- [Molecular Generation Models](https://github.com/molecularsets/moses)
- [Dataset of covid19 , South Korea](https://www.kaggle.com/kimjihoo/coronavirusdataset)
- [RCSB, Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/)
- [Kaggle, novel Coronavirus Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset/kernels)


As an example you can check this one [sars cov2](https://www.kaggle.com/michau96/sars-cov-2-china-and-rest-of-world/notebook). The User:- Michal Bogacz. He has done a comparative analysis between China where the virus has spread and the other countries where the virus has reached. The analysis is to examine the differences in the spread of the disease in China and other parts of the world.

[Coronavirus EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/shubhamai/coronavirus-eda-future-predictions/)- You can also check this one out. This user named Shubham ai has used a forecasting tool by Facebook called [Prophet](http://facebook.github.io/prophet/) for exponential smoothing and ARIMA to predict future deaths and confirmed cases.(*ARIMA, short for 'Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average' is actually a class of models that 'explains' a given time series based on its own past values, that is, its own lags and the lagged forecast errors, so that equation can be used to forecast future values*).

The reason why significant data analysis, statistical analysis is needed is because of the panic over the spread of the virus (You have seen how global stock markets and supply chains are being affected). One of the more important aspects of the spread is the rate of transmissibility. If the Rate is 1. It means 1 person can affect only 1 more Person. If the Rate is 2, it means 2 people will be affected by 1 affected person. 

To estimate how easily a virus spreads, scientists calculate its "basic reproduction number," or R0 (pronounced R-nought). R0 predicts the number of people who can catch a given bug from a single infected person. WHO's estimated (on Jan. 23) Ro to be between 1.4 and 2.5. 

Currently, Covid19 cases outside of China are growing exponentially, but is there a reason to worry about it and be anxious. 

### **Growth Factor**

Growth factor is the factor by which a quantity multiplies itself over time. The formula used is **(every day's new cases / new cases on the previous day)**. For example, a quantity growing by 7% every period (in this case daily) has a growth factor of 1.07.

A growth factor above 1 indicates an increase, whereas one which remains between 0 and 1 it is a sign of decline, with the quantity eventually becoming zero, whereas a growth factor constantly above 1 could signal exponential growth. 

Currently, the growth factor is at 1.15 to 1.25. According to the Current data.

*Image from Worldometre:- Growth Rate is subject to change.*


I was thinking about the Exponential Growth based on a few tweets I saw, and yesterday 3blue1brown came out with a video talking about exponential growth of Covid-19. The next part, is based on the video by 3blue1Brown.

### **Exponential Growth**

Let's say that,

 - $C_{d}$  is the number of cases everyday. 
 - $I$ is the average number of people someone infected is being exposed to on a given day.
 - $p$ is the probability of each of these exposures becoming an infection.

 The formula boils down to:-

 $\Delta C_{d} = I.p. C_{d}$

 where,  $\Delta C_{d}$ is the change in the number of cases everyday.

 We add these cases to get the next day's cases.

Hence,  $$C_{d+1} = C_{d} + I.p. C_{d}$$

So, $$C_{d+1} = C_{d}(1+I.p).....(1)$$

which is $$C_{d+1} = (1+I.p)^d. C_{o}....(2)$$ 

where $C_{o}$ is the total number of cases. 

If we  account for the probability that a person we are exposed to isn’t already infected, then the equation would be:-
$(1 - Numberofpeopleinfected)$

So,

$(1 - C_{d}/Pop. size)$. 

The $(1+I.p)$ part is equal to 1.15 or 1.25. It will always be greater than 1. This can be well visualized with the logarithmic scale. So, if the growth factor is always greater than 1, does it imply , that it can only reduce once the entire population is saturated...!!. That is of course the worst case scenario. 

The way in which the $(1+I.p)$ part can be reduced if we can contain the infected and allow less travel and less public gatherings and  encourage people to wash their hands regularly , so that $I$, exposure can be reduced and the number of infections $p$ can go down and also $\Delta C_{d}$ will be subsequently reduced. It is extremely sensitive to the constant.

**Lets do an experiment :-**

So, cases outside of China are growing at 14 percent as I am writing this and we are at about 111,000 cases now , so in 30 days, the number of cases we will reach according to equation (2) is:-

**(1.14)^30 x 111,000 = 5.65 million cases approximately.**

But, if we can contain more people as Italy is doing right now ([16 million people under quarantine](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/coronavirus-italy-16-million-people-forced-quarantine-200309105406206.html)), we can significantly reduce the number of cases. 

If people travelled less and washed their hands more, the number would reduce. Let's say it came down to 4 percent from 14 (reduced by a factor of 3.5). Then in 30 days, once again according to formula (2).

**(1.04)^30 x 111,000 = 360,000 cases approximately.** 

Now, that is a much bigger difference than a  factor of 3.5. Almost by a factor of 15.7 !!

Therefore, using stricter measures we can definitely reduce the number of cases.

Obviously exponential growth can’t go on forever, since otherwise there would be more people infected than people in the world! Therefore, eventually, infection rates must always be decreasing, resulting in an s-shaped (known as sigmoid) growth rate over time.

This is to give you an idea about how exponential growth works. The evaluation, is going to provide the readers with atleast some resources to combat misinformation. Especially, if you spot some misinterpreted statistic on social media. For more on this topic, watch the full video by [3blue1brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kas0tIxDvrg).

### **Flattening the Curve**

Recently, public health experts and government officials have been repeatedly referencing the importance of “flattening the curve”. But what does this mean, exactly?

When faced by a threat such as Covid-19, epidemiologists often look for two important numbers: how infectious a disease is, quantified by the number of people infected by each person infected, and the total number of people who die as a result of catching the illness.

A key goal of public health officials now is to avoid a huge peak in Covid-19 cases . 

This is extremely important, because if we can slow down the rate of infection in a community, then we give hospitals in that community time to deal with both the infected patients, and with the regular patient load that they need to handle. This is described as “flattening the curve”. So, overtime it turns the steep mountain of cases into a more sedate hillock.

**Delaying the development of outbreaks and lowering infection rates ensures healthcare systems do not exceed capacity**

## **COVID-19:- A Drug design Appraoch**

There is a worldwide consolidated effort that is ongoing in terms of drug discovery. Since, the cases range from mild to severe, we need to provide immediate attention to those whose cases are severe. We need to be pro active in such conditions. The Drug discovery approaches that are getting the most attention right now are:-

- Vaccine Development
- Antibody Development
- Small Molecule Development.

Out of these three, the one that needs significantly less domain expertise is small molecule development.

[Moderna](https://www.businessinsider.com/moderna-coronavirus-vaccine-development-inside-the-lab-ceo-interview-2020-3), [Inovio Pharm.](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/03/03/inovio-pharmaceuticals-accelerates-timeline-for-it.aspx), [Novavax](http://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-advances-development-novel-covid-19-vaccine) are currently trying to develop vaccines that can be released this year. 

Another approach is Antibody Development, where an antibody can be developed in order to prevent the virus from binding with the receptor protein of the host cell. This can prevent the virus from replicating. The Antibody can be binded to the virus.

The next feasible approach is small molecule development. 
Computational drug discovery is now one of the most popular techniques for drug discovery. We can use publicly available datasets for further analysis. 

### **Computational drug design**

The most fundamental goal in drug design is to predict whether a given molecule will bind to a target and if so how strongly. Molecular mechanics or molecular dynamics is most often used to estimate the strength of the intermolecular interaction between the small molecule and its biological target. -wiki. 


A few weeks ago , a 3D structure was published on the
protein databank titled ["The main protease of the novel coronavirus in complex with an inhibitor N3"](http://www.rcsb.org/structure/6LU7) 

![insert picture of 3D diagram](https://cdn.rcsb.org/images/rutgers/lu/6lu7/6lu7.pdb1-500.jpg)


*Biological Assembly 1 of the crystal structure .Image from RCSB Protein Data Bank*

[3D View](http://www.rcsb.org/3d-view/6LU7). You can also download the files in PDB format.

Let's break down what all of this means:-

- Enzymes catalyzes chemical reactions and in this case it divides other proteins up into smaller components which help the virus replicate. We want to prevent or inhibit this replication process.

-  The available structure already has an inhibitor (*An enzyme inhibitor is a molecule that binds to an enzyme and decreases its activity.*) attached to it called N3 which was previously designed to target earlier known versions of the coronavirus. 
 
- It will not be effective for the novel coronavirus, so here is a chance to design one of our own.


- We have been provided with a 3D structure of the coronavirus ,we can design an inhibitor for it but in order to do so we have to first identify a proper binding site.

(*In biochemistry and molecular biology, a binding site is a region on a macromolecule such as a protein that binds to another molecule with specificity.*)

-  (SARS CoV2 Protein + key -> docking-> complex)

![alt_text](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/97/Docking_representation_2.png/510px-Docking_representation_2.png)

*Docking Representation:- Image-wiki*

- Think of it like inserting a "key", ligand , into a lock. Protein is the "lock". The benefit of having the N3 inhibitor already there is that we  know of at least one binding site . Once we've found a binding site we'll need to either find an existing inhibitor from a drug database like a [zinc](https://zinc.docking.org/) that contains millions of drugs or generate a novel one ourselves. This is the problem.

![alt_text](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/satarupa-150913042909-lva1-app6892/95/basics-of-molecular-docking-5-638.jpg?cb=1442118658)

*Refer to this Docking Glossary while reading the steps. Image = slideshare*

- We won't definitely know if the lock and the key will actually turn out to be an inhibitor, the only way to find out is to try docking. So, (Our Ligand + binding site on CoV2 protein --->docking---> Inhibitor ??)

- If it successfully docks , [AutoDock Vina](http://vina.scripps.edu/) we can learn based on its binding pattern if it's a potential inhibitor or not. We can also find out a  measure of how  the inhibitor binds and if we dock many different ligands we can rank them by a score to find the best potential inhibitor. Ranking.

- Once found we can send it to a lab for synthesis and clinical trial testing

One such Example has been put forth by [insilico medicine](https://insilico.com/ncov-sprint). Insilico Medicine recently published a [paper](https://2019ncov.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/Insilico-Medicine-Generative-Sprint-2019-nCoV-Project.pdf) where the authors had extracted the 3D Structure first and then used 28 different machine learning models to generate the molecular structure for potential ligands. 
the models were optimized through reinforcement learning getting rewarded
every time they generated a candidate that more closely approximated with the Binding Parametres.

*ncov small molecule generation process.Image from the paper*

> "We launched Insilico Medicine’s generative chemistry platform for every input data type: crystal
structure, homology model and co-crystalized ligand...During the generative phase, a total of 28 machine learning (ML) models generated molecular
structures and optimized them with reinforcement learning (RL) employing the reward function. We used different ML approaches such as generative autoencoders,
generative adversarial networks, genetic algorithms, and language models. The models exploited various molecular representations, including fingerprints, string representations, and graphs. Every model was optimizing the reward function to explore the chemical space, exploit promising clusters, and generate new molecules with high scores. The rewarding function was a
weighted sum of multiple intermediate rewards: medicinal chemistry and drug-likeness scoring..."- from the Generative Pipeline Section of [Potential 2019-nCoV 3C-like protease inhibitors designed using generative deep
learning approaches](https://2019ncov.s3.ap-east-1.amazonaws.com/Insilico-Medicine-Generative-Sprint-2019-nCoV-Project.pdf) Alex Zhavoronkov, et.al.

This method of using Deep Reinforcement Learning can be proved to be useful. The method combines the pattern recognition capabiility of Neural Networks and the reward function of Reinforcement Learning in order to find better approximations.The authors have used their integrated AI-based drug discovery pipeline to generate novel drug compounds against 2019-nCoV. The results have been proved to be cost-effective.


#### **Example 2:- [Computational predictions of protein structures associated with COVID-19 by DeepMind](https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/computational-predictions-of-protein-structures-associated-with-COVID-19)**


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The <a href="https://twitter.com/DeepMind?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@DeepMind</a> team is sharing predictions of some protein structures associated with the virus that causes COVID-19, generated by the latest AlphaFold system. We hope this will help researchers around the world in their current efforts.<a href="https://t.co/E6MmAoZD9e">https://t.co/E6MmAoZD9e</a></p>&mdash; Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) <a href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1235672334658240512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 5, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

**Background on Alphafold**

AlphaFold works in two steps. Alphafold starts with  multiple sequence alignments.

 It compares a protein’s sequence with similar ones in a database to reveal pairs of amino acids that don’t lie next to each other in a chain, but that tend to appear in tandem. 
 
 This suggests that these two amino acids are located near each other in the folded protein. DeepMind trained a neural network to take such pairings and predict the distance between two paired amino acids in the folded protein.
 
 By comparing its predictions with precisely measured distances in proteins, it learnt to make better guesses about how proteins would fold up. A parallel neural network predicted the angles of the joints between consecutive amino acids in the folded protein chain.

But these steps can’t predict a structure by themselves, because the exact set of distances and angles predicted might not be physically possible. So in a second step, AlphaFold created a physically possible — but nearly random — folding arrangement for a sequence. Instead of another neural network, it used gradient descent to iteratively refine the structure so it came close to the (not-quite-possible) predictions from the first step.


So, in other words, The AlphaFold is an end to end pipeline. It starts off with a sequence, and then it outputs at the very end a full blown protein model. 

**The COVID-19 Response**

In March of 2020, DeepMind Published predictions of a few protein strutures. Using the genomes sequences of the virus that were published to publicly available databases the researchers could develop tests for this novel pathogen. The researchers released structure predictions of several under-studied proteins associated with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. It’s important to note that the structure prediction system is still in development.

**Why is it important to understand protein structures**

> "Knowing a protein’s structure provides an important resource for understanding how it functions, but experiments to determine the structure can take months or longer, and some prove to be intractable. For this reason, researchers have been developing computational methods to predict protein structure from the amino acid sequence.  In cases where the structure of a similar protein has already been experimentally determined, algorithms based on “template modelling” are able to provide accurate predictions of the protein structure. AlphaFold, our [recently published](https://rdcu.be/b0mtx) deep learning system, focuses on predicting protein structure accurately when no structures of similar proteins are available, called “free modelling”.  We’ve continued to improve these methods since that publication and want to provide the most useful predictions, so we’re sharing predicted structures for some of the proteins in SARS-CoV-2 generated using our newly-developed methods."- DeepMind


The structures have been published [here](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-com-v3-datasets/alphafold-covid19/structures_4_3_2020.zip)

## **COVID-19 Computer Vision Approach**

There are several Vision based approach, that one can pursue in order to provide a deeper insight. Here are some, that have been used so far.

**[SenseTime’s Facial Recognition](https://www.sensetime.com/en/Technology/face.html)**

Facial recognition is safer than fingerprinting as it removes the chances of disease being spread through human-to-surface contact.

So, SenseTime is  scanning the faces of the people with masks. They are promoting contactless identification of the infected with their temperature detection software that has been deployed at underground stations, schools and other community places in Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen. 

**China’s [inferVISION](https://www.wired.com/story/chinese-hospitals-deploy-ai-help-diagnose-covid-19/) Scans Patients**

Doctors in China have been given a new powerful tool to help them quickly diagnose potential coronavirus sufferers. Called inferVISION, this AI-based software can quickly highlight potential problem cases in record time.

The software relies heavily on NVIDIA’s Clara SDKs, which is NVIDIA’s AI healthcare application framework for AI-powered Medical Imaging.

inferVISION can identify typical signs or partial signs of COVID-19 in suspected patients. In order to do this, the software looks out for signs of pneumonia that can be caused by the virus.

I saw the tweet by Prof. Chollet and decided to look into it. The research by the authors aimed at constructing a system based on deep learning for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia on high resolution CT, this relieves the working pressure of radiologists.

> " For model development and validation, 46,096 anonymous images from 106 admitted patients, including 51 patients of laboratory confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia and 55 control  patients of other diseases in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (Wuhan, Hubei province, China) were retrospectively collected and processed. Twenty-seven consecutive patients undergoing CT scans in Feb, 5, 2020 in Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University were prospectively collected to evaluate and compare the efficiency of radiologists against 2019-CoV pneumonia
 with that of the model. "- from the abstract of the paper.

**Datasets:-**  A total of 46,096 CT scan images from 51 COVID-19 pneumonia patients and 55 control patients of other disease were collected for developing the model to detect COVID-19 pneumonia. After filtering those images, 35355 images were selected and split into training and retrospectively testing datasets.

**Training Algorithm:-** UNet++, a novel and powerful architecture for medical image segmentation was implemented to  develop the model. The authors first  trained UNet++ to extract valid areas in CT images using 289 randomly selected CT images and tested it in other 600 randomly selected CT images. 

**Findings:-** For 27 prospective patients, the model achieved a comparable performance to that of expert radiologist. With the assistance of the model, the reading time of radiologists was greatly decreased by 65%. 

 The authors concluded that the deep learning model showed a comparable performance with expert radiologist, and greatly improve the efficiency of radiologists in clinical practice.


You can read about the experiment in details in the paper link given above. This was an oversimplification of the methods, experiment, findings.

There are definitely more resources that you cn find on the drug discovery aspect of covid19. Many more solutions involving Machine learning are slowly coming up. In the meantime, I encourage you to look for more. There's not much left for me to talk about preventive measures as the governments locally and on a federal level are always quick to spread awareness. Keep yourself and others safe and remember, we are all in this together.
