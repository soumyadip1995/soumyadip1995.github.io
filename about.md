Hello Humanoids..!!. This is Soumyadip Nandi. An avid AI enthusiast who loves to read. An undergrad in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering, I am always looking to learn more and apply along the way. The focus is to help others who are currently in the same path as I am. My primary interests are in Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing. I blog on different topics. [Visit my blog here](https://aiactivated.blogspot.com/).  When I am not coding or writing about ML, I am usually into history and psychology. Life should always revolve around the global maxima.
