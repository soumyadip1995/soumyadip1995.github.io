# About



Hello Humanoids..!!. This is Soumyadip.  I have done my undergrad in Applied Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering from Heritage Institute of Technology , Kolkata. I worked in Deep Learning, computer vision, NLP since then. You can check out my Github.  Currently studying theoretical  physics A few Key words I am interested in :- QFT, Gauge theory, string theory, Supersymmetry.  Blogs will be on physics topics, AI, Math etc. You can read my previous blog posts 
[here](https://aiactivated.blogspot.com/). It has been a long time since I last updated those. But, maybe some of it still holds value.
I had created an archive long back on [wordpress](https://soumyadipnandi.wordpress.com/). I am looking to make a substack as well. [Github](https://github.com/soumyadip1995)
